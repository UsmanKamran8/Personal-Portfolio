            <br>My name is Usman. I was born and raised in Kansas City, where I developed a deep interest in technology and cybersecurity. This passion led me to pursue a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Cybersecurity at Rockhurst University, with the goal of building a career focused on protecting digital systems and information.          
            I am passionate about combining my technical and creative strengths to contribute meaningfully to the evolving landscape of cybersecurity. My goal is to become a well-rounded professional capable of securing digital environments while also creating user-friendly web solutions.
